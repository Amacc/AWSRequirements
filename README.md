# AWSRequirements

## Why
Generally in AWS many resources come together to what i would consider a 
component of an overall software system. This can mean the setting up of
many sns topics and sqs queues to support the processing engine whether
it be directly in something like lambda or a fargate container.

## Vision
Code can be declared and then parsed to find the overall needs of the
component. _An example might be a package.json for a serverless deployment._
This can be parsed and compiled into a requirements document and deployed into
a live environment.
